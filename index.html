<p class = "textArea">Jon created Hand Painted as a forum for art enthusiasts who want to take their art with them wherever they go. Attach your favorite 4 x 6 or 8 x 10 piece of art directly onto our custom laptop covers.  We are on our laptops so often that it seems fitting we'd express ourselves creatively through our laptop covers.</p>
